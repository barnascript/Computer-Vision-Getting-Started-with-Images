# Getting Started with Images
This is my first project where I took my first steps in learning Image Processing and Computer Vision using OpenCV. 
I learnt some important lessons using some simple examples. In this notebook, I learnt the following:
* Reading an image
* Check image attributes like datatype and shape
* Matrix representation of an image in Numpy
* Color Images and splitting/merging image channels
* Displaying images using matplotlib
* Saving images
